# Power Functions Recorder

Recording commands from LEGO Power Functions remote controls and playing them. Using IR Receiver Module Iduino ST1089 and IR 940 nm emitting diode.

### Features:
- all PF remote controls are supported
- saveing 10 recordings 
- possibility to play in reverse order
- possibility to reverse commands from specified channel and output

### Functions
- start/stop record - Button A or Rremote Control Red Forward
- start/stop play - Button B or RC Red Backward
- next record number - Button AB or RC Blue Forward 
- previous record number - RC Blue Backward 
- playing commands in reverse order - RC Red and Blue Forward
- playing reversed commands (from channel 1) in reverse order  - RC Red and Blue Backward

** Sometimes program registers more commands because some commands are missed by LEGO PF receiver.**

## :warning: Warning!
**Lighting the diode and the IR receiver with sunlight :sunny: or from an ordinary light bulb :bulb: may interfere with the signal reception.**
